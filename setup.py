# This script creates a Python distribution wheel for the Slycat python interface, 
# now called slypi, formerly called slycat-web-client.  When run, it copies the latest 
# version of the slycat/web/client files (from the slycat repo) into slypi directory 
# (see note below) before it constructs the pip installable module.
#
# NOTE: You need to have the slycat directory (from github) available as ../slycat
# in order to run the setup.py file (see additional note below).

# To publish to PyPi, perform the following steps:
#
# $ rm -rf dist
# $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
# $ twine upload dist/*
#
# To publish to testpypi, use:
#
# $ twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
#
# The first step builds the distribution, and the second step
# uploads to PyPi.  To install the package from another computer use:
#
# $ pip install slpyi
#
# To install from testpypi, use:
#
# $ pip install --extra-index-url https://testpypi.python.org/pypi slpyi
#   --upgrade --trusted-host testpypi.python.org --proxy wwwproxy.sandia.gov:80
#
# To install locally, use (from this directory):
#
# $ pip install -e .
